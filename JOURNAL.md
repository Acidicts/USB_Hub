## 10/27/2025 4 PM - Research + Schematic 1 hr  

Read through hackclub's usb 2.0 usb_hub tutorial. Followed along and deviated at some points. Such as using double the usb ports and using a different diode.

## 10/27/2025 5:01 PM - Routed the PCB - 0.7hours  

Routed the pcb although not the most interesting design it should give the ports the least strain when weight placed on the by putting on one side, also increases user accessibility.

## 10/27/2025 5:02 PM - Decorated the pcb  - 0.3 hrs  

Added a bad joke "electricity and data junction" but this joke is "very necessary". Added hackclub logo so I always remember why I made it and "Cars" to link back to the joke mentioned prior.
